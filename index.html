<h3>About Me</h3>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span> 
Senior Undergraduate Student in Theoretical Physics at University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez (UPRM). Expected graduation date on June 2020 with Magma Cum Laude Honors. 
<br> Starting my graduate studies for a PhD in Physics at Harvard University next Fall 2020.

<span class="fa fa-flask about-icon"></span> 
Research assistant, advised by <a href="http://charma.uprm.edu/~malik/">Dr. Sudhir Malik</a>. CERN member, part of the <a href="https://cms.cern/">CMS collaboration</a>, with current interests in <b>Supersymmetry</b> (SUSY) and <b>Dark Matter</b> analysis.

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span> 
I enjoy using useful & reusable software tools for HEP Analysis. In the past years I've acquired an expertise in the development of workflows for reproducible analysis through the <a href="https://reana.io">ReANA </a> platform and use of SUSY Analysis Tools.

<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span> 
I love to partake in any form of art (painting, dancing, singing, acting, and more). I enjoy travelling to new places, interacting with different cultures and meeting new people around the world.

I grew up in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I've been abroad in Europe while working at CERN for a few months. I'm planning to move to pursue my graduate studies in the near future.

<h3>Research Experience</h3>

<p class="text-justify">
  As a UPRM student, I became a member of the CMS experiment and quickly began acclimating to the software and analysis tools environment. 
The CMS experiment is one of the main experiments at the LHC at CERN, a prestigious research laboratory of particle physics based at Geneva, Switzerland. 
I've been working remotely on Supersymmetry Analysis, with a focus on the search for new physics targeting final states with one or more top quarks. 
Furthermore, I have had to train a top tagging algorithm that implements a combination of three approaches to top tagging in order to get the best efficiency over the largest range of top transverse momentum. 
Currently I’m working to plot basic variables and histograms of the HT and Nt distributions after the baseline selection and of the MET distributions. 
I’ve have to face some roadblocks but soon I’ll focus on Machine Learning for SUSY.
