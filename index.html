<h3>About Me</h3>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span> 
Senior Undergraduate Student in Theoretical Physics at University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez (UPRM). <br> Expected graduation date on June 2020 with Magma Cum Laude Honors. 
<br> Starting my graduate studies for a PhD in Physics at Harvard University next Fall 2020.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-flask about-icon"></span> 
Research assistant, advised by <a href="http://charma.uprm.edu/~malik/">Dr. Sudhir Malik</a>. CERN member, part of the <a href="https://cms.cern/">CMS collaboration</a>, with current interests in <b>Supersymmetry</b> (SUSY) and <b>Dark Matter</b> analysis.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span> 
I enjoy using useful & reusable software tools for HEP Analysis. In the past years I've acquired an expertise in the development of workflows for reproducible analysis through the <a href="https://reana.io">ReANA </a> platform and use of SUSY Analysis Tools.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span> 
I love to partake in any form of art (painting, dancing, singing, acting, and more). I enjoy travelling to new places, interacting with different cultures and meeting new people around the world. 
</p>

<span class="fa fa-globe about-icon"></span> 
I grew up in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I've been abroad in Europe while working at CERN for a few months. I'm planning to move to pursue my graduate studies in the near future.

<h3>Research Experience</h3>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fal fa-atom about-icon"></span><b>CMS Experimet</b>: CERN & CMSLPC at Fermilab
<br> The CMS experiment is one of the main experiments at the LHC at CERN, a prestigious research laboratory of particle physics based at Geneva, Switzerland. 
<ul>
  <li> <b>Supersymmetry Analysis</b>: a focus on the search for new physics targeting final states with one or more top quarks. </li>
  <li> <b>Higgs Analysis</b>: Higgs to four-leptons decay channel analysis reimplementation as a case study for reproducible analysis with 2011-2012 CMS Open Data. </li>
  <li> <b>Data Reconstruction</b>: Reprocessing AOD from 2010 - 2012 RAW samples for Machine Learching processes. </li>
  <li> <b>Detector's Hardware</b>: Strain Gauge Measurements of Carbon Fiber Dee for the CMS Phase-2 Upgrade of the Tracker Forward Pixel Detector.</li>
  <li> <b>Top Analysis</b>: Top quark mass measurement from b-jet energy spectrum at 13TeV </li>
</ul>
<br> Brief collaboration in the department of Innovative Algotithms from <a href="https://iris-hep.org/">IrisHEP </a>.
