<h3>About Me</h3>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span> 
Senior Undergraduate Student in Theoretical Physics at University of Puerto Rico, Mayag√ºez (UPRM). Expected graduation date on June 2020 with Magma Cum Laude Honors.

<span class="fa fa-flask about-icon"></span> 
Research assistant, advised by <a href="http://charma.uprm.edu/~malik/">Dr. Sudhir Malik</a>. CERN member, part of the <a href="https://cms.cern/">CMS collaboration</a>, with current interests in <b>Supersymmetry</b> (SUSY) and <b>Dark Matter</b> analysis.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span> 
I enjoy using useful & reusable software tools for HEP Analysis. In the past years I've acquired an expertise in the development of workflows for reproducible analysis through the <a href="reana.io">ReANA </a> platform and use of SUSY Analysis Tools.

<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span> 
I love to partake in any form of art (painting, dancing, singing, acting, and more). I enjoy travelling to new places, interacting with different cultures and meeting new people around the world.

I grew up in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I've been abroad in Europe while working at CERN for a few months. I'm planning to move to pursue my graduate studies.
