<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span> 
I enjoy using useful & reusable software tools for HEP Analysis. In the past years I've acquired an expertise in the development of workflows for reproducible analysis through the <a href="reana.io">ReANA </a> platform and use of SUSY Analysis Tools.

I love to partake in any form of art (painting, dancing, singing, acting, and more). I enjoy travelling to new places, interacting with different cultures and meeting new people around the world.
