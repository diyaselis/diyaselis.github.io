<h3>About Me</h3>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-graduation-cap about-icon"></span>
Started my graduate studies at Harvard University in 2020 under the PhD program in High Energy Physics - Experimental.
<br> Previously completed a B.S. in Theoretical Physics at University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez (UPRM), conferred June 2020.

<span class="fa fa-flask about-icon"></span>
PhD candidate and part of the <a href="https://lppc.physics.harvard.edu/people/diyaselis-delgado">LPPC research group</a> at Harvard University. 
<br> Currently I'm a member of the <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/">IceCube collaboration</a>, advised by <a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/carlos-arg%C3%BCelles"> Carlos A. Argüelles Delgado </a>, with research interests in High Energy <b> Neutrino Physics </b> and <b>Beyond Standard Model </b>(BSM)  studies.
<br> Formerly a CERN member, part of the <a href="https://atlas.cern/">ATLAS collaboration</a>, with interests in <b>Supersymmetry</b> (SUSY) and <b>Dark Matter</b> connections.
During my undergraduate career, I was a research assistant, advised by <a href="http://charma.uprm.edu/~malik/">Dr. Sudhir Malik</a>, under the CMS experiment of CERN's LHC collaboration.

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-code about-icon"></span>
Computational focus on Machine Learning (ML) techniques for event energy reconstruction for the IceCube detector.
<br> Additionally, I enjoy using useful & reusable software tools for HEP Analysis. In the past years I've acquired an expertise in the development of workflows for reproducible analysis through the <a href="https://reana.io">ReANA </a> platform and use of SUSY Analysis Tools.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-heart about-icon"></span>
I love to partake in any form of art (painting, dancing, singing, acting, and more). I enjoy travelling to new places, interacting with different cultures and meeting new people around the world.
</p>

<p class="about-text">
<span class="fa fa-globe about-icon"></span>
I grew up in San Juan, Puerto Rico. I've been briefly in Geneva, Switzerland while working at CERN. Currently, stationed in the Boston area for my graduate studies.
